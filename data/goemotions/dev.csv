5,I see him doing that.
19,I'm 39 and still love being given chocolate.
5,Women have a right to their own bodies. Your comments are horribly patronizing. They indicate that women intellectually develop slower than men which is sexist.

2,Funny you say that... krav maga is quite popular in Evanston.

5,"Genuinely, it is! The only complaint is that kentrosaurus is spikey as hell, and I find him with my foot in the dark fairly often..."
