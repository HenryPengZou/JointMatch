## Setup
### Install Package 
```bash
conda create -n jointmatch python=3.8 -y
conda activate jointmatch

# install pytorch
conda install pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision==0.13.1 torchaudio==0.12.1 -c pytorch

# install dependency
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Data Preparation
The file structure should look like:

```bash
code/
  |-- criterions
  |-- models
  |-- utils
  |-- main.py
  |-- panel_main.py 
  ......
data/
  |-- ag_news
  |-- imdb
  |-- yahoo
    |-- train.csv
    |-- val.csv
    |-- test.csv
    ......
```

## Reproduce Paper Results

To reproduce our main paper results, simply run: 
```bash
python panel_main.py
```
    
Specify the dataset, output location if you need, e.g., dataset = 'ag_news' and experiment_home = './experiment'. 

To reproduce results with varying number of labeled data, simply run:
```bash
python panel_num_labels.py
```

## Bugs or Questions

If you have any questions related to the code or the paper, feel free to email Henry Peng Zou (pzou3@uic.edu). If you encounter any problems when using the code, or want to report a bug, you can open an issue. Please try to specify the problem with details so we can help you better and quicker!
